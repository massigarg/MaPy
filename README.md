# MaPy
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/h0zeRkm.png)

MaPy is a script that creates a map using the Folium module for Python. 
It will place on the map as many pins as the number of pictures with GPS Exif data.
All the pins will have the date info and when clicked they will show the picture in the exact spot it has been shot.
The folder_name.html file it creates contain all the pictures in the folder it is executed in.

# Why?

Why not? After a short trip abroad I thought it was a good idea to place all of my pictures in the exact spot I shot them and
store theese infos in a file so I can have a look at it even in the future.
